# Per-technology 6T SRAM bitcell dimensions (width_um, height_um).
#  - asap7   : 0.108 x 0.270 um — published in Clark et al.,
#              "ASAP7: A 7-nm finFET predictive PDK",
#              Microelectronics Journal 2016 (2 contacted-poly-pitches x
#              10 fin-pitches; 0.0292 um^2 bitcell).
#  - sky130hd: 1.070 x 1.740 um — published bitcell from the
#              skywater-pdk OpenRAM 6T SRAM (~1.86 um^2 bitcell).
#  - gt2n     : 0.0917 x 0.2291 um (~0.021 um^2) — the previous value (1 site width x
#              1 site height, ~0.0060 um^2) was an unvalidated placeholder cross-checked
#              only against an unrelated non-SRAM design's (floonoc) overall die-area
#              scaling ratio, not any real device data. Replaced with TSMC's own
#              disclosed 2nm-class (N2) high-density SRAM bitcell area (~0.021 um^2,
#              "A 38.1Mb/mm2 SRAM in a 2nm-CMOS-Nanosheet Technology",
#              research.tsmc.com/page/memory/4.html; no published W x H breakdown found
#              for that figure, so the area alone is the sourced quantity). Split at a
#              2.5 height:width aspect matching asap7's real bitcell aspect (0.270/0.108
#              = 2.5), not sky130hd's (1.626) — asap7 is a FinFET predictive PDK, a much
#              closer device-architecture analog to gt2n's GAAFET nanosheet transistors
#              than sky130hd's 130nm planar bulk process, even though neither is a
#              literal GAA measurement. Reflects the real "SRAM scaling wall" — SRAM
#              bitcell area has scaled far slower than logic across process nodes, so a
#              device-realistic macro is *larger* relative to gt2n's very fine row pitch
#              than the old placeholder assumed, not smaller.
